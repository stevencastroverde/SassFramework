# SassFramework

Hello everyone!

 This is just a collection of scss files that I have used before, and I wanted to save them for use in other projects. The grid I used is based off Susy so you will need that as a dependency in your project. Also, in the customAnimations file I created two mixins you can use to incorporate animate.css effects into your project. Everything with ng-enter or ng-leave is for ngAnimate in Angular. If you aren't using Angular feel free to delete that.
